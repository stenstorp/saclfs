--- SCRIPTS ---

          bob - Package builder
  buildrootfs - Creates a compressed root filesystem for booting on target machine (combines makedirs and compress)
     cleanall - Removes all built software, logs, root filesystem. USE ONLY WHEN SURE YOU WANT TO REMOVE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE BUILT!!!
     compress - Compresses the built root filesystem to be extracted on target machine
     makedirs - Creates FHS compliant directories, essential symlinks and files
    post-base - Strip debug symbols and makes neccesary files
         prep - Prepares build directory and creates symlinks
    reset-all - Runs cleanall then prep
     semiauto - Resets everything, builds everything and compresses root filesystem (combines reset-all, bob build cross-compiler, bob build cross-system and buildrootfs)
version-check - Clfs dependency version checker

--- FILES ---

deps - some dependencies
info - environment variables

--- FOLDERS ---

    logs - logs of builds
packages - instructions for bob to build packages
 sources - source archives for packages
    work - where packages are compiled
    clfs - root filesystem for clfs

--- GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS ---

Tip: To avoid permission isses, run all scripts with su/sudo or as root

1: Run ./prep to make essential directories
2: Run ./bob build cross-compiler to build the cross compiler
3: Run ./bob build cross-system to build a bootable system
3.5: Check the logs in the logs directory for errors
4: Run ./bob download all to download all the sources for the rest of the system
5: Run ./buildrootfs to make a compressed root filesystem
5.5: Instead of steps 1-4 run ./semiauto if you are sure there are no errors
6: Transfer to compressed root filesystem to the target system
7: On the target system WITH A PRE-EXISTING LINUX SYSTEM WITH YABOOT INSTALLED, extract the root filesystem to an empty partition.
8: Reboot the system.
9: At yaboot, select 'l' for linux and at the boot prompt, type "hd:X,/tools/boot/vmlinux-VER root=/dev/sdYX" Where X is the partition number, Y is the drive and VER is the kernel version (currently 4.19.1)
10: After it has booted login as "root" (no password) and cd to builder
11: Run ./bob build base-system to build all system software. THIS WILL TAKE A LONG TIME, > 10 HOURS
11.5: Check the logs in the logs directory for errors
12: Run ./post-base to strip debug symbols and make neccesary files
13: Edit the /etc/fstab file and add your root filesystem otherwise it will default to a read-only state. E.g "/dev/sda4 / ext4 defaults 0 0"
14: Reboot the system.
15: At yaboot, select 'l' for linux and at the boot prompt, type "hd:X,/boot/vmlinux-VER root=/dev/sdYX" Where X is the partition number, Y is the drive and VER is the kernel version (currently 4.19.1)
16: You should have a working system!!

--- NOTABLE CHANGES FROM CLFS ---

- Many packages are later versions than specified in clfs
- Many upstream patches not applied as lastest versions of software is used
- Some powerpc specific patches applied as well as patches to fix other software packages
- Added libffi, python3, libxml2, libxslt, docbook-xml, docbook-xsl, meson and ninja as systemd now depends on them
- Systemd builds with ninja and meson
- Removed yaboot as I can't get it to build
- Custom kernel configuration based off of pmac32_defconfig with added filesystem compatibility and other options to support systemd

--- TODO ---

- Extend kernel configuration
- Fail package building properly
- Implement dependency resolution
- Implement basic packaging system?

--- KNOWN ISSUES ---

- Binutils fails when building with bob on target system. To build successfully, cd to "work/binutils/[version]/binutils-build" and run "make && make install".
